By focusing on the intersections between climate change and ecological systems, students will develop the ability to integrate information from a variety of disciplines, including geosciences, biology, ecology, chemistry, and other areas of interest. The course will also involve practical training in the computer lab. Students will develop an intermediate complexity mathematical model, calibrate the model and assess the goodness-of-fit against observed data, identify the most influential model parameters (sensitivity analysis), and present their results.Jointly offered with EES1118H",

   "description": "The quality of our health care system is dependent on initial and ongoing education supporting our health professionals. In response to ongoing and new challenges in health care, governments and institutions respond with novel ideas of enacting health care in improved ways. Health care institutions, policy makers, and the public have expectations of highly skilled, knowledgeable, and prepared individuals. As our understanding of health and health systems change, these expectations also change. Keeping up is in part the work of health professions education. Preparing individuals for these dynamic, complex, in some cases unpredictable, and everchanging health care service demands is necessary and complex. In this course, we explore the role and governance, structure, and contemporary multidisciplinary scientific advances of initial and continuing health professions education as a means of supporting the practice and quality of health care. We also explore the future of health professions and how health professions education is working to keep up.",

The clinical neuropsychologist uses standardized tests to objectively describe the breadth, severity and veracity of emotional, cognitive, behavioral and intellectual functioning. Inferences are made on the basis of accumulated research. The clinical neuropsychologist interprets every aspect of the examination (both quantitative and qualitative components) to ascertain the relative emotional, cognitive, behavioural and intellectual strengths and weaknesses of a patient with suspected or known (neuro)psychopathology. Findings from a neuropsychological examination can be used to make diagnoses, inform rehabilitation strategies, and direct various aspects of patient care.

It traces the lives and political thought of Black women and gender-non-conforming people who refused and fled enslavement, took part in individual and collective struggles against segregated labour, education, and immigration practices; providing a historical context for the emergence of the contemporary queer-led #BlackLivesMatter movement. Students will be introduced, through histories of activism, resistance, and refusal, to multiple concepts and currents in Black feminist studies. This includes, for example, theories of power, race, and gender, transnational/diasporic Black feminisms, Black-Indigenous solidarities, abolition and decolonization. Students will participate in experiential learning and engage an interdisciplinary array of key texts and readings including primary and secondary sources, oral histories, and online archives.",
